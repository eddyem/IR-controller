The work begins
First PCB have been prodused, so I need "only" to solder elements & finish the code

Pinout of MCI is in file schematics/STM32_PINS


-- OLD --

This is a sketch for futher work
I found that libopencm3 is more friendly than SPL. Also I have some new thoughts about modular system: for
flexibility.

The beginning of the work is being done on an Olimex development board "STM32P103", in future I plan
to complete my own board based on STM32F103VBT6, so linker would be modifying.
